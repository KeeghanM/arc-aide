### Understanding Campaigns

Campaigns are the top-level containers for organizing your D&D adventures. Each campaign can contain:

- Multiple story arcs
- Campaign entities (NPCs, locations, items)
- Custom entity types
- Rich text descriptions and notes

## The Arc Framework

ArcAide uses a structured six-part framework to help you create compelling storylines:

### 1. Hook

The opening scene or inciting incident that draws your players into the story.

**Example:** _"While traveling to Phandalin, the party discovers an abandoned wagon with signs of a struggle and goblin tracks leading into the woods."_

### 2. Protagonist

The main character(s) or heroes of this particular story arc.

**Example:** _"The adventuring party, hired by Gundren Rockseeker to escort supplies to Phandalin."_

### 3. Antagonist

The opposition, conflict source, or "villain" of the arc.

**Example:** _"Klarg, the bugbear leader of a goblin tribe that has captured Gundren and his escort."_

### 4. Problem

The central challenge or conflict that needs to be resolved.

**Example:** _"Gundren has been captured and his location is unknown. The supplies he was expecting are crucial for the town's defense."_

### 5. Key

The solution, tool, method, or insight needed to resolve the problem.

**Example:** _"Following the goblin tracks to their hideout, gathering information from captured goblins, and staging a rescue mission."_

### 6. Outcome

The resolution and consequences of the arc's events.

**Example:** _"Gundren is rescued and reveals the location of Wave Echo Cave. The party learns about the Black Spider's involvement."_

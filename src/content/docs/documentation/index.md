## Core Features

ArcAide provides everything you need for compelling D&D campaign management:

### üìñ Arc-Based Storytelling

Structure your narratives using our proven six-part framework: Hook, Protagonist, Antagonist, Problem, Key, and Outcome. Create hierarchical arc relationships with parent and child storylines.

### üè∞ Entity Management

Organize your campaign world with custom entity types (NPCs, Locations, Items, Organizations) and rich descriptions using our powerful editor.

### üîç Smart Search & Discovery

Find any content instantly with full-text search across all campaign materials, including fuzzy matching for typos and spell correction.

### üì§ Publishing & Content Sharing

Share your campaign content with players using the publishing system. Control exactly what information is visible with paragraph-level secret content management.

### üéØ Campaign Organization

Manage multiple campaigns with clear navigation, quick creation tools, and seamless content linking.

## Documentation Philosophy

:::note[Our Approach to Documentation]
We believe that good documentation starts with well-written code. Documentation should complement the code, not replace it.
:::

As developers, we believe that good documentation starts with well-written code. If your code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices, it will be easier to understand and maintain. Documentation should complement the code, not replace it.

We write documentation not for ourselves or our current team, but for future developers who weren't there when we first wrote this code. Documentation is a living document that should be updated as the code changes.

# Enhanced Editor & Navigation Updates

## üéâ Features

### Enhanced Text Editor

- **Interactive Toolbar**: Added a comprehensive editor toolbar with formatting buttons for bold, italic, underline, images, links, and headers
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implemented keyboard shortcuts for text formatting (Ctrl+B for bold, Ctrl+I for italic, Ctrl+U for underline)
- **Toolbar Auto-show**: Toolbar automatically appears when the editor gains focus and hides when focus is lost
- **Table Support**: Added table insertion functionality through the toolbar
- **Heading Levels**: Dropdown selector for different heading levels (H1-H5)
- **Link Integration**: Quick insertion of internal links using `[[]]` syntax
- **Image Insertion**: One-click image markdown insertion with placeholder syntax

### Editor Architecture Improvements

- **Modular Components**: Refactored editor into separate, maintainable components:
  - `editor-toolbar.tsx` - Toolbar functionality
  - `editor-leaf.tsx` - Text rendering and formatting
  - `editor-decorations.ts` - Syntax highlighting and decorations
  - `editor-utils.ts` - Shared utility functions
- **Better Focus Management**: Improved focus handling to prevent toolbar interactions from disrupting editor focus
- **Enhanced Formatting Logic**: Smart formatting that can wrap selected text or insert formatting markers at cursor position

### Navigation Refinements

- **Conditional Search Bar**: Search bar now only appears when inside a campaign context, hidden on main dashboard
- **Consistent URL Structure**: All navigation links now properly end with trailing slashes for consistency
- **Improved Layout Logic**: Better conditional rendering for campaign-specific navigation elements

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Code Organization

- **Component Separation**: Split monolithic editor component into focused, single-responsibility components
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript types with proper custom editor interfaces
- **Utility Functions**: Extracted common formatting logic into reusable utility functions
- **Clean Architecture**: Better separation between UI components and business logic

### Performance Optimizations

- **Event Handling**: Optimized keyboard event handling to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Focus Management**: Improved focus state management to reduce component updates
- **Mouse Event Prevention**: Proper event prevention in toolbar to maintain editor focus

### Bug Fixes

- **Editor Focus**: Fixed issue where clicking toolbar buttons would cause editor to lose focus
- **Text Formatting**: Corrected text decoration property name from `underlined` to `underline`
- **Campaign Updates**: Fixed campaign `updatedAt` timestamps to reflect content changes within campaigns
- **Link Consistency**: Ensured all internal links follow consistent URL patterns

## üé® User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for active formatting options
- **Intuitive Controls**: Icon-based toolbar buttons for common formatting actions

- **Keyboard Workflows**: Support for keyboard-driven text formatting workflows

### Interface Polish

- **Responsive Toolbar**: Toolbar adapts to different screen sizes and editor contexts
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified styling approach across all editor components
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Improved distinction between different text elements and formatting options

## üèóÔ∏è Developer Experience

### Maintainability

- **Modular Architecture**: Easier to maintain and extend individual editor components
- **Clear Separation**: Distinct files for different editor concerns (rendering, decoration, utilities)
- **Reusable Logic**: Shared utilities that can be used across different editor contexts
- **Better Testing Surface**: Smaller, focused components are easier to test individually

This release significantly enhances the content creation experience while maintaining the clean, focused interface that Arc Aide is known for.

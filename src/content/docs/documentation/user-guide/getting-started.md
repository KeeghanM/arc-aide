- Multiple story arcs
- Campaign entities (NPCs, locations, items)
- Custom entity types
- Rich text descriptions and notes

## The Arc Framework

ArcAide uses a structured six-part framework to help you create compelling storylines:

### 1. Hook

This hook immediately presents a mystery and potential danger, giving players a clear reason to investigate.

</details>

### 2. Protagonist

The main character(s) or heroes of this particular story arc.

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Protagonist</summary>

Clear identification of who the heroes are and their initial motivation.

A clear problem statement that drives the story forward.

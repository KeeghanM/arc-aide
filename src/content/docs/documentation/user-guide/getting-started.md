## Understanding Campaigns

Campaigns are the top-level containers for organizing your D&D adventures. Each campaign can contain:

- Multiple story arcs
- Campaign entities (NPCs, locations, items)
- Custom entity types
- Rich text descriptions and notes

## The Arc Framework

:::note[Storytelling Structure]
ArcAide uses a structured six-part framework to help you create compelling storylines. This framework is based on proven narrative techniques adapted for tabletop RPGs.
:::

ArcAide uses a structured six-part framework to help you create compelling storylines:

### 1. Hook

The opening scene or inciting incident that draws your players into the story.

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Hook</summary>

_"While traveling to Phandalin, the party discovers an abandoned wagon with signs of a struggle and goblin tracks leading into the woods."_

This hook immediately presents a mystery and potential danger, giving players a clear reason to investigate.

</details>

### 2. Protagonist

The main character(s) or heroes of this particular story arc. **Note: This doesn't always mean the player characters!** Sometimes the protagonist is an NPC the party is helping, like a local temple priest trying to save their community.

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Protagonist</summary>

_"The adventuring party, hired by Gundren Rockseeker to escort supplies to Phandalin."_

In this case, the party are the protagonists. But it could also be: _"Gundren Rockseeker, a dwarf merchant trying to reclaim his family's lost mine."_ - with the party as allies helping the true protagonist.

</details>

### 3. Antagonist

The opposition, conflict source, or "villain" of the arc.

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Antagonist</summary>

_"Klarg, the bugbear leader of a goblin tribe that has captured Gundren and his escort."_

A specific, named threat that creates meaningful opposition to the protagonist's goals.

</details>

### 4. Problem

The central challenge or conflict that needs to be resolved. This should be specific and have clear stakes - what happens if it's not solved?

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Problem</summary>

_"Gundren has been captured and his location is unknown. Without his expertise and the supplies, the town of Phandalin will be vulnerable to threats and unable to rebuild."_

A clear problem statement that explains both the immediate issue and why it matters.

</details>

### 5. Key

The crucial discovery, revelation, tool, or insight needed to solve the problem. This is often a twist or piece of information that changes everything - **the one thing** the protagonists need to find out or obtain.

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Key</summary>

_"Learning that the goblins are working for someone called 'the Black Spider' and discovering the location of their hideout through captured goblin interrogation."_

The specific knowledge or revelation that unlocks the path to resolution.

</details>

### 6. Outcome

The resolution and consequences of the arc's events.

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Outcome</summary>

_"Gundren is rescued and reveals the location of Wave Echo Cave. The party learns about the Black Spider's involvement."_

How the arc concludes and sets up future story developments.

</details>

### 7. Notes

Additional notes and supplementary information that doesn't fit into the other categories.

<details>
<summary>Example: Lost Mine of Phandelver Notes</summary>

_"Player feedback: loved the goblin ambush tactics. Next time, add more environmental hazards to the hideout."_

Meta-information for improving future sessions.

</details>
